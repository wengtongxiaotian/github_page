Biologists, on the one hand, have found that diamond nanoparticles show promise as exceptionally robust fluorescent dyes, with many potential applications in biolabeling. Efforts over the past 10 years have led to ∼4-nm-sized nanodiamonds with a single fluorescent impurity inside that can be functionalized and internalized by cells without toxic effects . Physicists, on the other hand, have made tremendous progress in understanding and controlling the electronic properties of single impurities. One of these impurities, the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect, is furthermore magnetic and shows quantum behavior up to room temperature. Spurred by advances in single-molecule fluorescence, the detection of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) from a single NV defect was reported in 1997 . This initial experiment triggered an intense research effort in the context of quantum information science, and over the past decade, the NV center has become an iconic model system to develop a wide variety of quantum manipulation protocols.")])])],-1);i.render=function(a,i,d,l,c,h){return e(),t(n,null,[o,s,r],64)};export default i;
